  With technology advancing every day in more ways than we can imagine, travel has become a key focus point
  for development in our day of age. From electric cars to hydrogen powered planes, we can expect travel to change
  considerably in near future. One method of transportation however has overgone massive advancements in recent years;
  the train. Thanks to certain individuals who have come up with innovative concepts, the combination of magnets and 
  trains has recently come to light. This has sparked the creation of a new high-speed train – the maglev. This article 
  aims to provide you with a brief history of how the maglev came to be and the pros and cons so you can have a better 
  understanding of what transport may become available to you in the near future.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    Maglev is short for magnetic levitation train. The train can reach speeds of up to 375mph (603 km/h), currently
    making it the fastest train in the world (japanRailPass, 2022). With speeds such as this, seamlessly connecting
    major cities across expansive countries becomes very accessible, reducing travel times significantly.

<h3 id="Main">Main</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    The concept of maglevs first came to light during the early 1900s through an American professor named Robert Goddard and
    a French engineer named Emile Bachelet (Boslaugh, 2023). Following this, James Powell received the first patent for 
    maglev during the 1960s (Energy, 2016). The idea came to him in a traffic jam where he dreamed up the idea of using 
    superconducting magnetics to levitate a train car (Energy, 2016). 44 years later in 2004, the first commercially 
    operated superconducting Maglev train opened in Shanghai (Energy, 2016). 
    
    Despite complicated nature of superconducting magnets, the underlying concept is surprisingly straightforward. 
    Fundamentally, it aligns with the basic principle that opposite poles attract and like poles repel. Coupled with 
    phenomenon that magnets intensity increases when cooled, the maglev train became a real idea. Each train carriage 
    is fitted with repelling poles on the bottom the keep the train floating just above the magnetic tracks and alternating
    attracting poles on the sides to pull the train forward (Energy, 2016). 
    
    With many countries investing in maglev, it is apparent that there are many benefits to this new train compared
    to previous high-speed trains. One of these is the fact that due to the train having no physical contact to the
    track, there is very little friction therefore making it very efficient and fast at accelerating (Anon., 2023).
    Furthermore, once the track has been built, very little maintenance will be required (Anon., 2023). Maglev can 
    also handle a very high volume of passengers er hour and do so without air pollution (Anon., 2023). This is a big
    factor, especially considering how recently everything is starting to go green. 
    
    However, despite over a century of research and development, there are only six of these trains in operation today
    – three in China, two in South Korea and one in Japan (WIKIPEDIA, 2023).  Whilst there a many small reasons for this,
    one stands above all – price. The tracks for maglev are made of precious materials and have magnetic coils embedded 
    used by the electromagnets (Anon., 2023) This makes them considerably more expensive than normal high-speed rail. 
    For reference, Japan has high speed bullet trains which on average cost $104 million per km to build. The maglev 
    currently being built is estimated to be $178 million per km (Bhushan, 2015). This is a whopping 72% increase PER 
    KM for the maglev. With thousands of kilometres of track needing to be built, this is massively more expansive than
    usual bullet trains. Additionally, current railway infrastructure cannot be used by maglev so it will either be 
    replaced by the maglev system or an entirely new set up will be required (Bhushan, 2015).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
<pre>
    In conclusion, maglev represents a remarkable leap in transportation. As explored in this article, these trains 
    provide unparalleled speed, efficiency and sustainability. Whilst maglev has provided great strides forwards, 
    cost is still an underlying issue. However, with continued research, investment and collaboration bringing the
    cost could very well be within the realms of possibility.  Looking into the future, it is clear maglev holds the
    promise to revolutionizing the way we commute and travel between main cities. I see this not just as a technological
    marvel but a potential key to more efficient and sustainable transportation for the future.
